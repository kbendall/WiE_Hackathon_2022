# WiE_Hackathon_2022

## Purpose

This Discord Bot will address barriers to women and girls entering STEM fields. As a woman in STEM, I find online spaces to be the most intimidating. Often times, student run discord servers are dominated by men. This can make participating in conversations more intimidating.

## What it will do
- address sexist comments and ban offenders
- send inspirational quotes
- send a STEM based trivia/fun fact game
